`use_raster` is automatically set to TRUE for a matrix with more than
2000 rows. You can control `use_raster` argument by explicitly setting
TRUE/FALSE to it.

Set `ht_opt$message = FALSE` to turn off this message.
'magick' package is suggested to install to give better rasterization.

Set `ht_opt$message = FALSE` to turn off this message.
